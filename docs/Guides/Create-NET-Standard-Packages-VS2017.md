# Create .NET Standard 2.0 packages with Visual Studio 2017

*Applies to NuGet 4.x+ and MSBuild 15.3+ as provided with Visual Studio 2017 Update 3 and later. For earlier versions of Visual Studio 2017, these instructions apply to .NET Standard 1.4 to 1.6 by changing the \<TargetFramework\> property. Also see [Create .NET Standard Packages with Visual Studio 2015](../guides/create-net-standard-packages-vs2015.md) for working with NuGet 3.x+.*

The [.NET Standard Library](/dotnet/articles/standard/library) is a formal specification of .NET APIs intended to be available on all .NET runtimes, thus establishing greater uniformity in the .NET ecosystem. The .NET Standard Library defines a uniform set of BCL (Base Class Library) APIs for all .NET platforms to implement, independent of workload. It enables developers to produce libraries&mdash;and thus NuGet packages&mdash;that are usable across all .NET runtimes, and reduces if not eliminates platform-specific conditional compilation directives in shared code.

This guide walks you through creating a nuget package targeting .NET Standard Library 2.0 with Visual Studio 2017. (To target .NET Standard 1.4 to 1.6, change the value of `<TargetFramework>` property as noted.)

## Pre-requisites

- Visual Studio 2017 15.3 or later with the **.NET Core cross-platform development** workload installed. You can install the Community edition for free from [visualstudio.com](https://www.visualstudio.com/), or use the Professional and Enterprise editions.

## Create the .NET Standard class library project

1. In Visual Studio, **File > New > Project**, expand the **Visual C# > .NET Standard** node, select **Class Library (Net Standard)**, change the name to "AppLogger" (as used in this walkthrough), and select **OK**.

1. Change the build configuration to **Release**.

1. Right-click the AppLogger project in Solution Explorer, select **Properties**, select the **Build** tab, check the box for **XML documentation file**, and set the filename to just `AppLogger.xml`. Then save the project.

1. Add your code to the component, such as the following. (This code clearly just outputs messages to the console, but it suitable to demonstrate building a NuGet package):

    ```cs
    namespace AppLogger
    {
        public class Logger
        {
            public void Log(string text)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(text);
            }
        }
    }
    ```

1. Build the project (with the Release configuration) and check that DLL and XML files are produced within the `bin\Release\netstandard2.0` folder.

## Edit metadata in the .csproj file

With NuGet 4.0 and .NET Core projects, package metadata is contained directly in the `.csproj` file instead of external files such as a `.nuspec`. A full description of that metadata is found in [NuGet pack and restore as MSBuild targets](../reference/msbuild-targets.md#pack-target).

1. Right-click the project in Solution Explorer, select **Edit AppLogger.csproj**, and then edit the first property group to include package information such as the following:

    ```xml
    <PropertyGroup>
        <TargetFramework>netstandard2.0</TargetFramework>
        <PackageId>AppLogger.YOUR_NAME</PackageId>
        <PackageVersion>1.0.0</PackageVersion>
        <Authors>YOUR_NAME</Authors>
        <Description>Awesome application logging utility</Description>
        <PackageRequireLicenseAcceptance>false</PackageRequireLicenseAcceptance>
        <PackageReleaseNotes>First release</PackageReleaseNotes>
        <Copyright>Copyright 2017 (c) Contoso Corporation. All rights reserved.</Copyright>
        <PackageTags>logger logging logs</PackageTags>
    </PropertyGroup>
    ```

1. Save the project, then right-click the solution and select **Build Solution** to again generate all the files for the package, this time with the correct metadata.

## Package the component

NuGet 4.0 supports a pack target using MSBuild version 15.1+ (including MSBuild 15.3 as part of Visual Studio 2017 Update 3) when the project contains the necessary package metadata, as was added in the previous section. To invoke MSBuild in this way, simply specify the pack target on the command line in the same folder as the `.csproj` file:

    msbuild /t:pack /p:Configuration=Release

For additional options with `msbuild /t:pack`, such as including content files, symbols, and source code, see [NuGet pack and restore as MSBuild targets](../reference/msbuild-targets.md#pack-target).

In any case, the command above generates `AppLogger.YOUR_NAME.1.0.0.nupkg` in the `bin\Release` folder by default, as it builds that configuration. If you omit the `/p` switch, the default configuration will be `Debug`. 

Opening this file in a tool like the [NuGet Package Explorer](https://github.com/NuGetPackageExplorer/NuGetPackageExplorer) and expanding all the nodes, you see the following contents:

> [!Tip]
> A `.nupkg` file is just a ZIP file with a different extension. You can also examine package contents, then, by changing `.nupkg` to `.zip`, but remember to restore the extension before uploading a package to nuget.org.

To make your package available to other developers,  follow the instructions on [Publish a package](../create-packages/publish-a-package.md).
